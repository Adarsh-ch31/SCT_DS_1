 Task 1: Data Visualization â€“ Age and Gender Distribution

This project is the first task of my internship at **SkillCraft Technology**. The objective was to create visualizations using a sample dataset to understand the distribution of categorical and continuous variables.

---

 Objective

To explore and visualize:
- Age distribution** (continuous variable)
- Gender distribution** (categorical variable)

 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

 Dataset

A sample demographic dataset containing columns such as:
`Age
- Gender
- and other population indicators


Visualizations Created

1. **Histogram of Age Distribution**  
   Visualized the spread of population across different age groups.

2. **Bar Chart of Gender Distribution**  
   Showed counts of each gender present in the dataset.

 Conclusion

This task helped practice:
- Loading datasets using Pandas
- Exploring variable types (categorical vs continuous)
- Creating clean, informative visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib
